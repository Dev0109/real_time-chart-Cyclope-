		<h2>How does Cyclope comply to GDPR</h2>
		<div id="points1">
			<h3>We limit the collected data from the users.</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>We do not collect personal information (first name, last name, identity card data, bank accounts, etc.).</li>
				<li>We do not collect the content of: visited websites, used applications and documents, emails, chat conversations. We do not record screen captures nor do we record the keyboard activity.</li>
				<li>In case you want the recorded data to be pseudo-anonymized, you can activate this feature from the Administration section, Settings page and Other Settings tab. The option is called Pseudo-anonymize data. Once activated, it will obfuscate the usernames and all associated computer names, making it impossible to identify a certain employee based on the recorded data. The option is reversible. When potential breaches are identified, this option can be temporarily or permanently disabled.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>We offer to our employees control over the data we gather.</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Our recommendations towards each of our customers are:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>– Define the purpose (legitimate interest) for using the Cyclope application. For example: data security or confidentiality, automated processing (software) tracking for compliance with GDPR, employee productivity, etc.</li>
						<li>– Tell every employee that they are monitored by: operating rules / internal order, attachment to the work contract, notification of the applicable IT security policy.</li>
						<li>– Apply employee monitoring after obtaining prior approval. This agreement can be obtained by acknowledging and accepting any of the documents listed above.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Any employee may have easy access to all data collected by Cyclope about his work.</li>
				<li>The application allows the employer to easily export collected data about an employee and to delete this information if the employee requests it.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>We work with suppliers that are GDPR compliant.</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The suppliers we use for cloud-based services are GDPR compliant as well.</li>
